# 👋 Hey there, I'm Yiorgos

I love **mathematics**, **music**, and **basketball** — not necessarily in that order, and not always at the same time (math during a pickup game is tough).

When it comes to coding, I usually work on **whatever catches my interest** at the moment. I like exploring ideas, breaking things, and learning by building.

### 💻 What I’m up to
I work as a **DevOps Engineer** — which means I make things run, break, run again, and then automate the whole process so I don’t have to touch it twice.

### 🔧 Things I spend time on
- DevOps & infrastructure magic  
- Kubernetes (basically a degree of its own)  
- AI & ML things that may or may not become sentient  
- MCP (currently poking at this with curiosity and caution)  
- API development (I promise to document them… eventually)  
- Databases (because data has to live somewhere)  
- Anything technical that makes me say “oh, that’s cool”  

Always learning, always experimenting, but mostly wondering why something worked after changing *nothing*.
