# 👋 Hey there, I'm Yiorgos

Here's a unordered list of some of the things I love: **mathematics**, **music**, **basketball**, **cycling**, **hiking** — not necessarily in that order, and not always at the same time.

When it comes to coding, I am enitrely self taught and I usually work on **whatever catches my interest** at any given moment. I like exploring ideas, breaking things, and learning by building.

### 💻 What I’m up to
I am currently as a **DevOps Engineer** — which means I make things run, break, run again, and then automate the whole process so I don’t have to touch it twice. It also means that when *others* break things, I am usually among the first ones to know. 

### 🔧 Things I spend time thinking about, while looking at a comp screen
- DevOps & infrastructure magic  
- Kubernetes (basically a degree of its own)  
- AI & ML things that may or may not become sentient  
- MCP (currently poking at this with curiosity and caution)  
- API development (I promise to document them… eventually)  
- Databases (because data has to live somewhere)  
- Anything technical that makes me say “oh, that’s cool”  

#### I like exploring stuff, I like asking questions, I get a good feeling when things are working and sometimes I get an even better feeling when things aren't. What *really* pisses me off though, is when things eventually start working, even though nothing changed *at all*
