# 👋 Hey, I'm Yiorgos

I love **mathematics**, **music**, and **basketball** — they keep me curious, creative, and (mostly) sane.

When it comes to coding, I usually work on **whatever catches my interest** at the moment. I like exploring ideas, breaking things, and learning by building.

### 💻 What I’m up to
I work as a **DevOps Engineer**, but I don’t really limit myself to one lane.

### 🔧 Things I spend time on
- DevOps  
- Kubernetes (honestly a course by itself 😄)  
- AI & ML stuff  
- MCP (currently digging into this)  
- API development  
- Databases  
- Pretty much anything technical that sparks curiosity  

Always learning, always experimenting, and always open to new problems.
